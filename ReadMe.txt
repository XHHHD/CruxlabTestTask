This solution is created for a test task.
It should open a text file and read it line by line.
In each line, the program must find conditions and a password. After that, it should return the number of rows in which the password met the conditions.

The advantages of this solution are:
- Availability of a simple and accessible user interface.
- Can be used in conjunction with different user interfaces.
- Ability to scale and expand.
- Availability of unit tests.

To be honest, I don't have much experience with regular expressions. Because of this, I had to search for useful information on the Internet. I note that the development environment itself also helped to make the code more elegant with hints.
